	abstract = {Epiphytic lichen samples were collected in and around a city of 300 000 inhabitants in {NE} France to study the dispersion and fallout of Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb. Lichens hanging in small tree branches within a 15 km radius from the city centre, together with bus air filter aerosols and unleaded gasoline samples, were analysed to evaluate the relative contribution of anthropogenic metals. On an average, Pb and Cd concentrations and calculated enrichment factors in lichens showed a radial distribution from downtown, decreasing rapidly within 4 or 5 km and then less so towards more rural areas, whereas it is more diffuse for Cu and Zn despite the more elevated values close to the city centre. Metal concentrations can be interpreted in the light of major wind directions and/or secondary pollution sources to the atmosphere. Lichens sampled in the city and close to high traffic roads had 206Pb/207Pb ratios of about 1.13. This ratio was consistently higher (up to 1.157) for lichens sampled at only five kilometres from the city centre. On the other hand, urban aerosols (on bus air filters) have homogeneous 206Pb/207Pb ratios of 1.153±0.003. The variation in Pb isotopic composition in lichens can be interpreted as the result of mixing between different industrial sources and old Pb pollution from leaded gasoline combustion re-emitted into the atmosphere. Combining elemental concentrations and isotopic ratios allowed a better understanding of the atmospheric deposition of metals and related sources in urban areas. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Sulfur and lead isotope ratios in the atmosphere were measured at several selected sites (Harbin, Changchun, Dalian, Waliguan, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guiyang) in China and Tsukuba (Japan), to reveal regional sources characteristics over Eastern Asia. Average S isotope ratios for {SO}2 and sulfate in the atmosphere in China were close to those of the coals used in each region, indicating a considerable contribution of coal combustion to the sulfur compounds in the atmosphere. Most northern cities had around 5\% sulfur isotope ratio, while Guiyang, a southwestern city in China, showed a considerably lower sulfur isotope ratio (about -3\%) because of the unusually light sulfur isotope ratio of coals in this region. These were considerably different from the value (-1.4\%) for Tsukuba (Japan). Lead isotope ratios also suggested that coal combustion considerably contributed to atmospheric lead in some cases in China. At the same time, influences by the emission of Chinese lead ores were also observed in northern cities. Seasonal variations of both sulfur and lead isotope ratios indicated the existence of a certain amount of industrial sources other than coal combustion. In addition, fractionation effect between {SO}2 and sulfate showed a seasonal tendency (high in winter (0-6\%) and low in summer (-1-3\%)), suggesting the oxidation pathway of {SO}2 changed seasonally.},

For this purpose, two surveys were carried out in June and September 2012, measuring hydrographic, biological and chemical parameters along the water column at representative sites. The sources of trace elements were evaluated by measuring 208Pb/207Pb and 206Pb/207Pb isotope ratios and comparing them with the isotopic signature of the atmospheric particulate and marine sediments collected in the same area. It was found that natural input from the glaciers is the major source for Al, Co, Fe, K, Ti and V, whereas Ba, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn of anthropogenic origin are mainly introduced into the fjord through the intrusion of Atlantic waters. The influence of the glacial runoff decreased with the distance from the front and it was higher at the end of the summer season than in late spring. On the other hand, the effect of the Atlantic waters was more relevant in the bottom layer at the entrance of the fjord, especially during the summer season.},

	abstract = {In order to characterize airborne lead in eastern and central Russian cities in terms of lead isotope ratios, aerosol samples were collected at six selected cities and Moscow, and their lead concentrations and isotope ratios were studied by comparing them to the data of ore lead used in Russia. All eastern Russian cities (Vladivostok, Khabarovsk and Yakutsk) were found to have isotope ratios similar to those of ore leads in Kazakhstan, the major lead producer for Russia. Samples collected in Moscow also showed isotope ratios similar to those of eastern Russian cities. The contribution from coal combustion to airborne lead was considered to be small even in winter, in these cities. This observation suggested that the origin of lead in these Russian atmosphere regions is closely related to the lead products (e.g. leaded gasoline). The lead isotope ratios in three eastern Russian cities were very close to the value for Russian air mass reported previously in Japan, which were also in good agreement with the same observation in Sweden. However, considerably different lead isotope ratios were observed in central Russian cities, Kemerovo and Nizhnevartovsk, indicating that specific lead emissions, such as industrial activities using Precambrian-age ores or unique leaded gasoline, might contribute to the atmospheric lead.

	abstract = {Aerosols collected between 1994 and 1999 at more than 80 different sites affecting the atmospheric composition of the Northern Hemisphere have been measured for their 206Pb/ 207Pb, 208Pb/ 207Pb and 206Pb/ 204Pb ratios and Pb concentrations. The ratios are potentially useful for tracing sources of pollution and the movement of air-masses on a global scale. A change in isotopic composition compared to earlier measurements could be detected in the Western United States and parts of Europe, most probably due to long range transport of Pb pollution from China and Russia, respectively, and an increasing relative contribution of industrial Pb. The geographical variations found in the Pb isotopic composition of the aerosols made it possible to broadly characterize different regions via the 206Pb/ 207Pb ( 208Pb/ 207Pb) isotope ratios of the aerosols sampled: Eastern United States 1.173-1.231 (2.438-2.470); Western United States 1.159-1.188 (2.426-2.455); Canada 1.094-1.177 (2.365-2.438); Mexico 1.188-1.197 (2.452-2.463); Japan 1.153-1.162 (2.435-2.443); China 1.141-1.177 (2.435-2.465); Germany 1.133-1.165 (2.405-2.440); Spain and France 1.097-1.142 (2.372-2.410); Northern Italy 1.148-1.160 (2.419-2.430); Southern Italy 1.108-1.121 (2.376-2.387): 2.387); Eastern Europe and Russia 1.112-1.164 (2.355-2.446); North Africa and Arabian Peninsula 1.096-1.153 (2.361-2.431).

	abstract = {Epiphytic lichens collected from trees within northeastern North America (ca. 500,000km2) have been used as natural filters of airborne lead in order to document the spatial distribution of this metal in the atmosphere and identify its principal sources. Lichens record an integrated signal over a few years of atmospheric fall-out and thus minimise any signals due to variable (seasonal) atmospheric circulation patterns, and biases related to discrete events focusing atmospheric pollution from a single point source. The Pb/Al ratios measured in lichens are 20-600 times higher than that of upper crustal rocks, indicating that most of their Pb is of anthropogenic origin. Hence, their Pb isotopic composition is directly related to that of the pollution sources. The 206Pb/207Pb values for the lichens vary from 1.146 to 1.206 and these are interpreted as results of mixing between Canadian and {USA} industrial lead. Pb isotope ratios of lichens define a coherent geographic distribution since samples from the {US} have high 206Pb/207Pb, typical of {US} industrial Pb, whereas lichens sampled in northern Québec have the lowest 206Pb/207Pb, typical of Canadian industrial Pb. Lichens sampled along the St. Lawrence Valley have intermediate isotopic composition, which is interpreted as a result of mixing between {USA} and Canadian sources. {USA} industrial Pb contributes 75-35\% of the total atmospheric Pb in this area and the contribution decreases from Montréal towards the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Overall, geographic Pb isotope gradients may be sharp and indicate a strong control by both sources and prevailing meteorological conditions. From these results, it is possible to draw the first Pb isotopic distribution map of atmospheric Pb pollution over northeastern North America. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {To investigate the magnitude and origin of lead (Pb) pollution in the atmosphere of Xiamen, China, 40 aerosol samples were collected from the coast of Xiamen from January to December 2003. All these samples were measured for Pb isotopic compositions ((208)Pb/(206)Pb=2.10897 ± 0.00297, (207)Pb/(206)Pb=0.85767 ± 0.00159, n=40) using a Multi-collector-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer ({MC}-{ICPMS}). Thirty-five out of forty samples were also measured for Pb concentrations (79.1 ± 38.3 ng/m(3), n=35) by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy ({AAS}). The results indicate that the Pb concentrations display significant seasonal variations while Pb isotopic ratios remain relatively constant. The Pb concentrations were high in January and February, abruptly decreased in March, remained relatively constant (but low) from April to August, and then gradually increased from September to December. This corresponds to the rainless climate in winter and rain scavenging in summer. The higher Pb concentration of Xiamen aerosols in winter and spring may be also caused by long-range transferred anthropogenic Pb during the northeastern monsoon seasons. Although the use of leaded gasoline in Xiamen was banned in 2000, our new data indicate that the Pb annual concentrations of aerosols in Xiamen increased about 12\% when compared to the data measured between 1991 and 1993. Thus, Pb pollution in the atmosphere of Xiamen has not receded even after the phase-out of leaded gasoline. Our results further confirm the previous studies' conclusion that the primary source of atmospheric Pb in China, especially in South China, is the vast combustion of lead-containing coal, not leaded gasoline.},

Isotopic analysis indicated that mining and smelting activities in the Rudny Altay region (Central Eurasia), as well as industrial emission in north-eastern North America, were the main sources of atmospheric lead in spring and summer, respectively. During 2013, no significant differences between the two seasons were found (p-value \&gt; 0.3), showing a prolonged influence of Eurasian sources also in summer.
