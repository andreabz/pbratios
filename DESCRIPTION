Description: This package provide some functions to extract and process Pb isotope ratio
    data from raw .csv files provided by Perkin Elmer ELAN ICP-MS working in isotope ratio
    mode. The package provides function for extracting raw data from reports, calculate
    208Pb/207Pb, 206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/206Pb and 207Pb/206Pb ratios, remove outliers and 
    correct mass bias by standard bracketing  technique. Additionally, two function for 
    producing three-isotope plots are provided.
