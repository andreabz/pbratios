#' Raw csv dataset with Pb isotope ratio data for PM10 data.
#'
#' This raw dataset was obtained saving as .csv the original .rep file produced by
#' the mass spectrometer Perkin Elmer ELAN ICP-MS.
#'
#' Field separator are "," and decimal separator are ".". Standards with known Pb
#' isotope ratios are used to correct the instrumental mass bias by the bracketing
#' standard technique and are labelled as \code{SRM}. QC data are BCR CRM 482 and are
#' labelled as \code{CRM}. The dataset comprises PM10 samples collected from 2010 to 2014
#' at Ny-Ålensund (Svalbards, Norwegian Arctic).
